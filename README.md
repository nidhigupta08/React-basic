# React-basic
Collection of daily React programs and exercises for learning and practicing React fundamentals

The program constitutes a simple text utility application built with React, emphasizing the functional component paradigm. It comprises three main components:

TextForm Component:
Implements state management using the useState hook to facilitate user interactions.
Features a text area where users can input text.
Provides a button to convert the input text to uppercase.
Handles text input changes and conversion to uppercase seamlessly.

App Component (App.js):
Acts as the central hub of the application.
Integrates and renders the Navbar and TextForm components.
Employs props to supply the Navbar component with a title and about text.
Passes a heading prop to the TextForm component for enhanced customization.

Navbar Component:
Utilizes functional components to streamline development.
Receives props such as title and aboutText to tailor its content.
Features a navigation bar with links and a search form for enhanced user navigation.
Establishes default values for title and aboutText props for robustness.

Overall, these components work together to create a simple text utility application with a navigation bar and a text input area where users can convert the entered text to uppercase. The application is structured using React and follows the functional component approach. It demonstrates the use of state management, props, and hooks in React.
